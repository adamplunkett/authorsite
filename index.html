                            <p>"The critic Adam Plunkett expertly teases out the many meanings of Frost's poems... Blending biography and criticism, Plunkett shows how the circumstances of Frost's peripatetic life gave rise to some of his most successful poems. As in the best critical biographies, Plunkett does not merely track down real-world inspiration for a given work. Rather, he brings together Frost's personal life, literary sources, and publication history to enrich our understanding of the poems, then uses the poems to enhance our understanding of the life. The result is a thorough, elegant, and, at times, surprising study of Frost, who emerges as a remarkably complex poet and a compelling but complicated man." <br/>—<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/03/03/love-and-need-the-life-of-robert-frosts-poetry-adam-plunkett-book-review" target="_blank">Maggie Doherty, <em>The New Yorker</em></a></p>
                            <p>"In his excellent new biography, <em>Love and Need: The Life of Robert Frost's Poetry</em>, critic Adam Plunkett wrestles with how to fit [Frost's] mercurial work (no American poet shifts tones so suddenly or subtly as Frost) with [his] mercurial life…In Plunkett, Frost has found an ideal biographer, possessed of an ear for the tonal and moral uncertainties that constitute his subject's legacy." <br/>—<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2025/02/18/robert-frost-love-need-biography-adam-plunkett-review/" target="_blank">Anthony Domestico, <em>The Washington Post</em></a></p>
                            <p>"Plunkett's close readings of several of Frost's best poems brilliantly bring out the "hidden architecture" that underlies them all…Plunkett’s book, perhaps better than any other on Frost, illuminates the theological and spiritual core of Frost’s thought and art…<em>Love and Need</em> is the best introduction to Frost available, and a tonic even for those of us who already long ago chose to follow Frost into "those dark trees, / So old and firm they scarcely show the breeze."<br/>—<a href="https://thepointmag.com/criticism/the-way-to-a-poem/" target="_blank">Sam Gee, <em>The Point</em></a></p>

                            <p>"Just as Plunkett is the unique reader of Frost interested in both our studied and unstudied reactions to the poems, he is the unique biographer of Frost whose work is neither hagiography nor slander. His is a middle way of which, I think, Frost would approve."<br/>—<a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2025/03/17/is-robert-frost-even-a-good-poet/" target="_blank">Jessica Laser, <em>The Paris Review Daily</em> (Interview)</a></p>

                            <p>"In his definitive critical-biographical study, <em>Love and Need: The Life of Robert Frost's Poetry</em>, Adam Plunkett asserts that the man and his work, Frost and his poetry, are one…Plunkett restores the wonder of Frost's initial mystery as poet and person, his beguiling talk-song reverie, his otherworldly spell-casting."<br/>—<a href="https://artsfuse.org/305211/book-review-love-and-need-the-life-of-robert-frosts-poetry-into-a-new-clearing/" target="_blank">James Provencher, <em>The Arts Fuse</em></a></p>
                            <p>"Plunkett’s brilliant readings of Frost’s best-known poems offer refreshing, alternative interpretations...

Carrigan Jr., <em>Bookpage</em></a></p>
                            <p>"[<em>Love and Need</em>] offers something of a recuperation of the poet by reminding us that Frost's fierceness is also a source of the considerable power of his work…Plunkett excels at bringing the poems to life with contextual details and literary resonances." <br/>—<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/premium/3320057/separating-art-from-poet-review-love-and-need-the-life-of-robert-frosts-poetry-adam-plunkett/" target="_blank">Micah Mattix, <em>Washington Examiner</em></a></p>
                            <p>"In Adam Plunkett's new biography, <em>Love and Need</em>, both Frost and his work receive a fresh re-examination. Plunkett's own prose is smooth and compelling, inviting readers into a writer and a life more surprising than we suspected." <br/>—<a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/02/13/arts/robin-bernstein-freeman-challenge-prison-system/" target="_blank">Kate Tuttle, <em>The Boston Globe</em></a></p>
                            <p>"Adam Plunkett is an eloquent and meticulous writer, and his new biographical study of Robert Frost, <em>Love and Need</em>, is a welcome addition to a long list of excellent books on the poet…His work adds handsomely to our understanding of Frost, bringing us closer to the poems themselves."<br/>—<a href="https://theamericanscholar.org/chapters-and-verse/" target="_blank">Jay Parini, <em>The American Scholar</em></a></p>

                            <p>"[<em>Love and Need</em>] is powerful not only in its tellings of Frost's relationships, career and somewhat inaccessible inner life, but also in its analyses of Frost's poetry…An immensely challenging, worthwhile read."<br/>—<a href="https://lit.newcity.com/2025/02/20/robert-frosts-life-reclaimed-a-review-of-love-and-need-the-life-of-robert-frosts-poetry-by-adam-plunkett/" target="_blank">Natalia Nebel, <em>Newcity</em></a></p>
                            <p>"Adam Plunkett's superb new biography of Robert Frost [is] written not only as a searching commentary on a poet's life and work, and the influence of other poets on him, but as a deeply engaging dialogue with other Frost biographers, and how their personalities interacted with the poet, alternately illuminating and distorting the understanding of the man and his work. As tempted as some reviewers might be to call Mr. Plunkett's biography "definitive" because of his exquisitely balanced, Richard Ellmann-like narrative, his work too will have an expiration date, as I'm sure [Hans] Renders would say, because biography by definition is in flux over time, constantly accumulating new evidence and interpretations..."<br/>—<a href="https://www.nysun.com/article/robert-frost-and-the-future-of-biography" target="_blank">Carl Rollyson, <em>The New York Sun</em></a></p>
                            <p>"In <em>Love and Need</em>, Adam Plunkett peers at several poems to track the drift–some would say sublimation—of Frost’s character into the verse. He also reveals many of Frost’s rhetorical influences and borrowings from Shakespeare, Herrick, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Tennyson, Emerson and Browning... Plunkett’s lively narrative ... moves dexterously between the life, Frost’s relationships, the progression of the books, and Frost’s inspirational sources to limn Frost’s turbulent psyche and its interplay with the poems."<br/>—<a href="https://www.ronslate.com/book-notes-nonfiction-on-love-and-need-by-adam-plunkett-hypochondria-by-will-rees-the-only-face-by-herve-guibert/" target="_blank">Ron Slate, <em>On the Seawall</em></a></p>
                            <p>"I've been rereading Robert Frost lately. The immediate occasion is Adam Plunkett's superb new biography, <em>Love and Need: The Life of Robert Frost's Poetry</em>. But Frost is always worth returning to."<br/>—<a href="https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/inflooding-realm" target="_blank">Anthony Domestico (again!), <em>Commonweal</em></a></p>

Blending literary criticism and life writing in innovative ways, Plunkett offers new perspectives on Frost as a poet, friend, husband, lover, and father, and interrogates the damaging myths perpetuated by Frost's past biographers. Erudite, meticulously researched, and beautifully written, <em>Love and Need</em> is a brilliant tribute to one of America's most beloved, complex, and misunderstood poets." <br/>—Heather Clark, author of <em>Red Comet: The Short Life and Blazing Art of Sylvia Plath</em></p>
                            <p>"Adam Plunkett's book is an impressive fusion of biography and criticism, taking us through Frost's career from beginning to conclusion, always keeping closely in touch with the poems that matter most. Plunkett's own writing is notable for its poetic strength, for bold speculation along with a subtle humor worthy of its subject. Richly convincing, this is a major addition to our appreciation of Frost's achievement." <br/>—William Pritchard, author of <em>Frost: A Literary Life Reconsidered</em></p>
                            <p>"This is a book I have needed for years, without knowing how much I did. <em>Love and Need</em>, precisely titled, tells the story of great art attained in the course of ordinary human foibles and affections, varieties of decency and rage, in a particular American life. Adam Plunkett's patient, high-grade attention to Robert Frost's life and work cleans away the encrusted stupidities of fame." <br/>—Robert Pinsky</p>
                            <p>"This is an exemplary literary biography—concise, elegantly written, and appropriately focused on the life as a means for understanding the work. I wouldn't have thought I had much to discover about Robert Frost at this point, but Adam Plunkett's book has been a revelation to me." <br/>—Christian Wiman</p>
                            <p>"My contribution to <a href="https://www.ctpublic.org/show/the-colin-mcenroe-show/2025-02-24/beyond-woods-and-roads-the-life-and-poetry-of-robert-frost">this radio show</a>, aired by Connecticut Public Radio, is relatively short, most of the conversation quite rightly being with Adam Plunkett, author of an excellent new critical biography of Frost. Among other things, it's a balanced corrective to the unrelievedly disparaging one by Lawrance Thompson."<br/>—<a href="https://sydneylea.substack.com/p/some-commentary-on-robert-frost" target="_blank">Sydney Lea, former Poet Laureate of Vermont</a></p>
                            <p>"A critical biography of Robert Frost wouldn't rank among my reading priorities; the delight of Adam Plunkett's <em>Love and Need: The Life of Robert Frost's Poetry</em> rests on his consistently fresh interpretations and a prose style resistant to high art mummeries."<br/>—<a href="https://humanizingthevacuum.wordpress.com/2025/03/04/my-february-2025-reading/" target="_blank">Alfred Soto, <em>Humanizing the Vacuum</em></a></p>
                            <p>"I like what Plunkett has done. Some of his work is, frankly, amazing... The book is precisely written, albeit as though in a dream state. Plunkett is a poet and it shows."<br/>—<a href="https://niklas.reviews/adam-plunkett-love-and-need" target="_blank">Niklas Pivic, <em>Niklas Reviews</em></a></p>
                            <p>Very grateful to everyone quoted above for reading the book so generously.<br/>—Adam</p>
