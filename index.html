                            <p>"The critic Adam Plunkett expertly teases out the many meanings of Frost's poems . . . Blending biography and criticism, Plunkett shows how the circumstances of Frost's peripatetic life gave rise to some of his most successful poems. As in the best critical biographies, Plunkett does not merely track down real-world inspiration for a given work. Rather, he brings together Frost's personal life, literary sources, and publication history to enrich our understanding of the poems, then uses the poems to enhance our understanding of the life. The result is a thorough, elegant, and, at times, surprising study of Frost, who emerges as a remarkably complex poet and a compelling but complicated man." <br/>—<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/03/03/love-and-need-the-life-of-robert-frosts-poetry-adam-plunkett-book-review" target="_blank">Maggie Doherty, <em>The New Yorker</em></a></p>
                            <p>"In his excellent new biography, <em>Love and Need: The Life of Robert Frost's Poetry</em>, critic Adam Plunkett wrestles with how to fit [Frost's] mercurial work (no American poet shifts tones so suddenly or subtly as Frost) with [his] mercurial life…In Plunkett, Frost has found an ideal biographer, possessed of an ear for the tonal and moral uncertainties that constitute his subject's legacy." <br/>—<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2025/02/18/robert-frost-love-need-biography-adam-plunkett-review/" target="_blank">Anthony Domestico, <em>The Washington Post</em></a></p>
                            <p>"A capacious exploration of Frost's complicated life and poetry…A superb biography that neatly weaves in nuanced and insightful readings of many poems." <br/>—<a href="https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/adam-plunkett/love-and-need/" target="_blank"><em>Kirkus Reviews</em>, starred review</a></p>
                            <p>"'<em>Love and Need</em>' proves an illuminating tour of Frost's life as well as his afterlife on the page, and these nuanced readings deepen our understanding of his still-powerful poems."<br/>—<a href="https://www.wsj.com/arts-culture/books/love-and-need-review-robert-frosts-dark-journey-30025930" target="_blank">Abigail Deutsch, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a></p>
                            <p>"In his definitive critical-biographical study, <em>Love and Need: The Life of Robert Frost's Poetry</em>, Adam Plunkett asserts that the man and his work, Frost and his poetry, are one…Plunkett restores the wonder of Frost's initial mystery as poet and person, his beguiling talk-song reverie, his otherworldly spell-casting."<br/>—<a href="https://artsfuse.org/305211/book-review-love-and-need-the-life-of-robert-frosts-poetry-into-a-new-clearing/" target="_blank">James Provencher, <em>The Arts Fuse</em></a></p>
                            <p>"Plunkett's refined prose and his astute readings of Frost's poems in <em>Love and Need</em> offer a candid portrait of the poet's enduring creative genius." <br/>—<a href="https://www.bookpage.com/reviews/love-and-need-adam-plunkett-book-review/" target="_blank">Henry L. Carrigan Jr., <em>Bookpage</em></a></p>
                            <p>"[<em>Love and Need</em>] offers something of a recuperation of the poet by reminding us that Frost's fierceness is also a source of the considerable power of his work…Plunkett excels at bringing the poems to life with contextual details and literary resonances." <br/>—<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/premium/3320057/separating-art-from-poet-review-love-and-need-the-life-of-robert-frosts-poetry-adam-plunkett/" target="_blank">Micah Mattix, <em>Washington Examiner</em></a></p>
                            <p>"In Adam Plunkett's new biography, <em>Love and Need</em>, both Frost and his work receive a fresh re-examination. Plunkett's own prose is smooth and compelling, inviting readers into a writer and a life more surprising than we suspected." <br/>—<a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/02/13/arts/robin-bernstein-freeman-challenge-prison-system/" target="_blank">Kate Tuttle, <em>The Boston Globe</em></a></p>
                            <p>"Adam Plunkett is an eloquent and meticulous writer, and his new biographical study of Robert Frost, <em>Love and Need</em>, is a welcome addition to a long list of excellent books on the poet…His work adds handsomely to our understanding of Frost, bringing us closer to the poems themselves."<br/>—<a href="https://theamericanscholar.org/chapters-and-verse/" target="_blank">Jay Parini, <em>The American Scholar</em></a></p>
                            <p>"[<em>Love and Need</em>] is powerful not only in its tellings of Frost's relationships, career and somewhat inaccessible inner life, but also in its analyses of Frost's poetry…An immensely challenging, worthwhile read."<br/>—<a href="https://lit.newcity.com/2025/02/20/robert-frosts-life-reclaimed-a-review-of-love-and-need-the-life-of-robert-frosts-poetry-by-adam-plunkett/" target="_blank">Natalia Nebel, <em>Newcity</em></a></p>
                            <p>"In <em>Love and Need</em>, Adam Plunkett gives us a fresh, expansive, and intimate account of Robert Frost's life and poetry. Blending literary criticism and life writing in innovative ways, Plunkett offers new perspectives on Frost as a poet, friend, husband, lover, and father, and interrogates the damaging myths perpetuated by Frost's past biographers. Erudite, meticulously researched, and beautifully written, <em>Love and Need</em> is a brilliant tribute to one of America's most beloved, complex, and misunderstood poets." <br/>—Heather Clark, author of <em>Red Comet: The Short Life and Blazing Art of Sylvia Plath</em></p>
                            <p>"Adam Plunkett's book is an impressive fusion of biography and criticism, taking us through Frost's career from beginning to conclusion, always keeping closely in touch with the poems that matter most. Plunkett's own writing is notable for its poetic strength, for bold speculation along with a subtle humor worthy of its subject. Richly convincing, this is a major addition to our appreciation of Frost's achievement." <br/>—William Pritchard, author of <em>Frost: A Literary Life Reconsidered</em></p>
                            <p>"This is a book I have needed for years, without knowing how much I did. <em>Love and Need</em>, precisely titled, tells the story of great art attained in the course of ordinary human foibles and affections, varieties of decency and rage, in a particular American life. Adam Plunkett's patient, high-grade attention to Robert Frost's life and work cleans away the encrusted stupidities of fame." <br/>—Robert Pinsky</p>
                            <p>"This is an exemplary literary biography—concise, elegantly written, and appropriately focused on the life as a means for understanding the work. I wouldn't have thought I had much to discover about Robert Frost at this point, but Adam Plunkett's book has been a revelation to me." <br/>—Christian Wiman</p>
